      "\n",
      "The reason why artists are special is because they envision something we cannotthats what makes them truly creative So if you still want to say AI is art I dont know what more I can say to you Depends People commission artists to do a piece and yet that piece carries the artists vision and mind When you use a brush your hand is with it during the entire creation process The brush is a tool for your expression the image it paints is ultimately your effort and vision A product of a human experience \n",
      "\n",
      "You telling AI to do the same thing is entirely a false equivalency You arent with the AI during the creation process it is not a tool AI does not create it only copies and pastes from its database There is no human component or creativity to the AI you only feed it words It is not remotely similar to a tool The final picture the AI generates is not born through a human vision but just copy pasted pixels from stolen artworks \n",
      "\n",
      "And Im expecting soul from the art not from the AI Using AI to generate pretty images and calling it art is an insult to actual art Again if you think art is just pretty images go on ahead It is so weird to equate a brush and AI deleted Yep you too just dont put your blood and sweat in digital art go back to classic canvas and you will be safe from AI   \n",
      "the reason artists WERE special cause they can paint and we cant AI gives the power to the common people Artists still have their creative independence those with talents will not perish  On what What condition Of course its not JUST the animation but as any theatre nerd or movie buff knows all the elements contribute a great deal to the success of a movie And for Miyazaki his distinctive art style and effort is a huge part of his success\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes AI has a place but its place is not to remove people from their jobs and erase forms of culture though Its supposed to make life easier not just more uniform and bland Its supposed to open up the ability to pursue passions not substitute our passions for artificially generated piles of shit If we lose everything to AI then what does that say about us as a society What is left for us when the whole world functions on AI and nobody gets paid and nobody sees a point in doing anything because AI will just do it for me\n",

      "No field is greater than another sure but some fields require human touch and are better for it Creative fields mostly IMO Marketing is better with human touch cooking is better with human touch and art is definitely better with human touch Yup dude \n",
      " Did u also went to Allen raipur  Yeah dude youre just making a clown out of yourself now LMAO Theres no condition to the arts it can be anything deleted Kya lagra h Niklega tumhara Nope not from Allen Yo go there Hk sir padhate h kya chemistry Wait some more and ill see whos the clown So my shit is an art and I am an artist Money is not the motive sure but being able to make money in the field is still important to encourage creators to join who otherwise might not Dont know jitna padh sakta tha padhu abb dekhte h  have lost all my will to study PCM  Dont know Hk sir but AKM  SBH aur NRT the mere batch mei  Okay bro one last time\n",

      "Look for an artist its not just about thinking of an ideaits about putting in the hard work to bring that vision to life Unlike me just giving a reference picture and saying Hey can you generate this in Studio Ghibli style and keep the faces as original as possible \n",
      "\n",
      "Now lets say youre an engineer  Are you just worth me sitting in a chair and typing a prompt Depends if you think its art then its art for you and not for others if they wont acknowledge it deleted Same man fuck jee honestly I just want this time to pass atp all the best Pata nhi fir mera dost jata tha HK sir ko bakta tha so I asked Gn No bro ive had enough Its boring now bye I should start selling my shit people who buy it shouldnt be considered fools then\n",
      "And Ai art is not art for artists the same way shit isnt art for a sane person\n",
      "So they are giving their concerns and opinions like a normal person would when people will start buying my shirt as some art\n",
      "\n",
      "If there isnt a criteria of anything how is it any different from something else Humans learn about things that way For you to know what a fan is you need to differentiate what a fan isnt \n",
      "Is earwax an art Or boogers Or soil Or potatoes  tomatoes \n",
      "Is trash an art \n",
      "But you can use trash to create art but trash in itself isnt an art So there are some conditions for something to fit a definitionthats what definitions are for \n",

style second clip rain take hundred hand drawn frame raindrop placed intentionally contributes overall magic art reason he many award art replicate art ai without consent explicitly stated disdain ai disrespectful unethical necessary buy art live every human make art one way another point life u spend time perfecting art form respected fundamental form expression u world would incredibly sad place without art however mean individual ai entity entitled use someone elses art especially without consent compensation art industry suffered result industrialisation example weaving art fine muslin weaving lost u british industrialised cut thumb native muslin weaver never able recreate cloth year trying industrializing art ai perfect way lose generation art knowledge time conclusion art incredibly important u society respected even though something need live context person liking kid doesnt feel satisfied drawing becomes frustrated feel pain idk kid talking ill assume person jr right frustrating draw sometimes thing life accomplishing anything frustrating painful thats beauty preparing extremely difficult exam sometimes even get angry feel unsatisfied work still next day going say thing situation goal someone want achieve honestly regard want tell little story liked drawing drew many abstract thing kid grew thought drawing someone something adore bad decided draw till mastered drawing even even practice year wasting page draw page manga still afraid draw year ago friend showed ai art afraid draw disgusted grossed broke friendship friend month ago made year promised showed beautiful art surprised asked source find beautiful said replied ai happy havent given drawing sure even something consider bad best thing someone elses eye drew passion honestly amazing thing ai helped journey think decide become full time artist one day someone say wont hire ask computer make making computer machine able put passion heart drawing like one last thing please dont afraid making art place everyones creativity world dont judge harshly art like therapy care good matter made filled blank piece paper creativity please continue making art world still need great artist clearly far cant even find lmao maybe try respecting art artist created inappropriate reply religious hindu better dude rage bait smt cuz woman got didnt much say besides agreement mentioned difference haha primary focus ai tech rather people using youre right last part like go looking fanart ai generated fanart neither even interested know mainstream professional stuff consume like many others way good done ai probably different looking indie stuff get point exception feel like someone one skill say making game using ai art game id fine cause dude putting work love expect sure stealing source code using unfair monetary gain def crime dont think stop tech giant thats kinda going democratization idea concept personal work course rule preventing violation also resonate respect see used go internet good stuff used bad way whats solution people always typing prompt art lmao thats typing word look ai simply create art whatever generates every pixel come image already exists algorithm think imagine put spin generate anything isnt training data incapable original expression therefore incapable art get real art done human requires human vision originality even human made copy painting original artist attempt drawing thing even baby form original thought imagine thing never seen heard completely original thing ai least yet think art image outcome good luck believe art form human expression ai generate pretty image existing dataset dont hate ai hate strong word believe calling ai generated image art insult real art thats typing prompt creative guess im considered artist telling person subway make sandwich human typing prompt different human commissioning art another human say hey ill pay paint portrait fantasy lighting star background im still artist artist commissioned interpret idea go chatgpt midjourney whatever say hey paint portrait fantasy lighting star background youre still commissioner client artist thought process algorithmical process different thing choosing go bad defined constrains put decides good bad taught came understand kind persuasion tactic said meaning behind art artist want conveyand think taking help ai improve skill taking help general regarding art writing field good thing ai complete replacing art something dont approve hope understand mean mentioned food let use metaphor would using cake simplify human person bakes cake sell let say random ai case come steal slice paying human continues steal slice countless human baker frankenstein super cool multiflavour unique cake provides market free creation cake truly unique morally right consume ai called baker called baker merging people cake called artist people art called artist picture formed called art true didnt even consider main thought experiment set topic aint going anywhere lem confirm know wat youre talking else waste time consequence seriously telling human weaving doesnt involve creative expression weaving art form right guy machine produce design deleted removed narrow minded problem think human vision expression make art seen puffer fish circle wever bird nest intervened human considered wellknown art say fish vision mantis camouflage butterfly wing pattern neither human insect vision make considered natural art call movie director orchestra conductor artist dont even dance instructor artist ok think feeling solid logic art anything becomes easy loss value fine probably opinion change like industrial revolution people hated machine didnt feel good cloth made machine didnt feel right grown idk who wrong u buy machine made stuff people didnt keeping changing time ai art appreciate putting thought put little case cake wasnt stolen recipe example say someone stole recipe countless baker creates frankenstein super cool multiflavour unique cake provides market free case wouldnt even frankenstein monster suitable flavour way complement person stole wont repeat read recipe would get understanding cake made make new cake hope clear confusion model work doubt see ml model learn backpropogation hope give perspective thought experiment great theory real life come cost theft hope help didnt answer question instead changed topic demanding answer like said talk consequence first would like admit always right use tool used matter im denying weaving involve creative expression many form weaving especially industrial production primarily focused functionality rather artistic intent hand many art form like studio ghibli movie exist primarily expression consumption ai reproduce design lack human element like intent intuition emotional depth importantly ai generated artwork often trained copyrighted work without consent meaning artist havent compensated human would illegal ai company exploiting legal loophole collect train existing work without limit something efficient doesnt mean let ai take creative work entirely youre refusing see perspective likely youre artist would understand depth issue beyond efficiency replication john adam nd president united state said must study politics war son may liberty study mathematics philosophy son ought study mathematics philosophy geography natural history naval architecture navigation commerce agriculture order give child right study painting poetry music architecture statuary tapestry porcelain ai art take people ability make living art cause stagnation various art form cant see there point arguing man enjoying banter bruh cool people enjoying trend h bhai wbu art anything doesnt conscious vision called art whoever denies doesnt know single thing art someone accidentally drop paint creates beautiful scene ground even without vision doesnt mean art ai art also art people refuse accept tad bit confused thing found nature never equivalent generator creating pixel basis probability left reply explaining bird pufferfish arent fed like programme effort also havent actually ever considered butterfly wing pattern art pretty sure perhaps considered art almighty though would argue result evolution genetics arent narrow minded artist hardly compensated effort throughout history one benefited ai art moment big corporation there quote may like thought ai would mundane job could create ai creates mundane job dude talking human art like painting yes fish vision whats wrong statement animal make pattern lived experience life bird never taught make nest manages make never taught dance attract mate fish never even knew parent made sand pattern brain unique art made unique lived experience imagination ai cant anything outside database never make anything never seen dont even understand fundamental ingredient art lived experience soul art pretty image think go there point debate machine made clothes design people current generation people design clothes later help machine make think something similar might happen ai art never rejected ai dont know thinking reject something yeah ai like become real unalive everybody understand got cake wasnt stolen recipe bit cake represents final product right recipe would represent method ai learning human pick pencil draw picture stitching together already formed piece art ai gain understanding cake baked art created thank suggestion learn something though love learning research get back view im trying understand perspective though experiment thought happens insted ai model would comfertable go ahead ask question deleted ko mkc gifgiphynokyflacvau shit also art think best explanation art expression conscious thought person making prompt think doesnt express ai express prompt image conscious thought art even copy image created human expression perspective comprehend existing art express using creativity skill stupidly expecting soul tool retard something human feed prompt imago vision directing ai create brush soul throw brush canvas expect masterpiece human directs brush create art human directs ai tool create art ok since interested learning let give little perspective ok help probably make curious even human learn think see pattern world remove random noice internalise pattern art look good music make feel sort parameter tried hard enough could get represented number look picture dog cat know wee color outline shape etc thats learn see bunch cat bunch dog see pattern like ear eye nose etc ask draw cat remember pattern saw make cat cat remember make cat ai model process way complicated take image cat say cat sleeping bed process get image compare image wanted either reward punish prosses similar human neurological connection strengthen weekend baised right wrong something similar change model get similar image million image simplification model doesnt even look image teaching small concept model understand relation thing supposed etc like looking paining making brain image saw picture iron man cow boy think iron man horse right cant take brain artist everone make beautiful art brain artist bring life ai model mix concept way model output isnt thought image give imagination power take away power people better execution drawing give power really creative thing describe whats mind word model describe image ai model doesnt copy like think take pattern learning image see brings together manner make image soo good hope helped wont go anymore detail want learn youtube pleased know question dont think im misunderstanding think understanding wider long term effect kind ai art specific example miyazaki artist like spent long time perfecting art dozen frame per second hand drawn art movie movie magical intentionality art every raindrop every colour every frame placed intention thats something ai capable yet random consumer dont realise still look still say oh well thats close enough real thing ultimately devalues art effort put craft process imagination involved image lose magical movie like miyazakis future people wont want go field work underappreciated underpaid keep mind cultural phenomenon miyazakis work across globe day value effort put work valuable work ai devalues making poor imitation commercially ai try replicate miyazaki fundamentally lacking magic make specific art special people wont realise theyve done late art form lost like muslin weaver mughal india tragedy unethical dont get wrong place ai art place dropper one thing say thisart look visually appealing expressing soul behind good luck future youre fighting ai job youve poured blood tear work would feel someone bit prompt engineering knowledge took away everything made special reason artist special envision something cannotthats make truly creative still want say ai art dont know say depends people commission artist piece yet piece carry artist vision mind use brush hand entire creation process brush tool expression image paint ultimately effort vision product human experience telling ai thing entirely false equivalency arent ai creation process tool ai create copy paste database human component creativity ai feed word remotely similar tool final picture ai generates born human vision copy pasted pixel stolen artwork im expecting soul art ai using ai generate pretty image calling art insult actual art think art pretty image go ahead weird equate brush ai deleted yep dont put blood sweat digital art go back classic canvas safe ai reason artist special cause paint cant ai give power common people artist still creative independence talent perish condition course animation theatre nerd movie buff know element contribute great deal success movie miyazaki distinctive art style effort huge part success yes ai place place remove people job erase form culture though supposed make life easier uniform bland supposed open ability pursue passion substitute passion artificially generated pile shit lose everything ai say u society left u whole world function ai nobody get paid nobody see point anything ai field greater another sure field require human touch better creative field mostly imo marketing better human touch cooking better human touch art definitely better human touch yup dude u also went allen raipur yeah dude youre making clown lmao there condition art anything deleted kya lagra h niklega tumhara nope allen yo go hk sir padhate h kya chemistry wait ill see who clown shit art artist money motive sure able make money field still important encourage creator join otherwise might dont know jitna padh sakta tha padhu abb dekhte h lost study pcm dont know hk sir akm sbh aur nrt mere batch mei okay bro one last time look artist thinking ideaits putting hard work bring vision life unlike giving reference picture saying

time pas atp best pata nhi fir mera dost jata tha hk sir ko bakta tha asked gn bro ive enough boring bye start selling shit people buy shouldnt considered fool ai art art artist way shit isnt art sane

      "The reason why artists are special is because they envision something we cannotthats what makes them truly creative So if you still want to say AI is art I dont know what more I can say to you Depends People commission artists to do a piece and yet that piece carries the artists vision and mind When you use a brush your hand is with it during the entire creation process The brush is a tool for your expression the image it paints is ultimately your effort and vision A product of a human experience \n",
      "\n",
      "You telling AI to do the same thing is entirely a false equivalency You arent with the AI during the creation process it is not a tool AI does not create it only copies and pastes from its database There is no human component or creativity to the AI you only feed it words It is not remotely similar to a tool The final picture the AI generates is not born through a human vision but just copy pasted pixels from stolen artworks \n",
      "\n",
      "And Im expecting soul from the art not from the AI Using AI to generate pretty images and calling it art is an insult to actual art Again if you think art is just pretty images go on ahead It is so weird to equate a brush and AI deleted Yep you too just dont put your blood and sweat in digital art go back to classic canvas and you will be safe from AI   \n",
      "the reason artists WERE special cause they can paint and we cant AI gives the power to the common people Artists still have their creative independence those with talents will not perish  On what What condition Of course its not JUST the animation but as any theatre nerd or movie buff knows all the elements contribute a great deal to the success of a movie And for Miyazaki his distinctive art style and effort is a huge part of his success\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes AI has a place but its place is not to remove people from their jobs and erase forms of culture though Its supposed to make life easier not just more uniform and bland Its supposed to open up the ability to pursue passions not substitute our passions for artificially generated piles of shit If we lose everything to AI then what does that say about us as a society What is left for us when the whole world functions on AI and nobody gets paid and nobody sees a point in doing anything because AI will just do it for me\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "No field is greater than another sure but some fields require human touch and are better for it Creative fields mostly IMO Marketing is better with human touch cooking is better with human touch and art is definitely better with human touch Yup dude \n",
      " Did u also went to Allen raipur  Yeah dude youre just making a clown out of yourself now LMAO Theres no condition to the arts it can be anything deleted Kya lagra h Niklega tumhara Nope not from Allen Yo go there Hk sir padhate h kya chemistry Wait some more and ill see whos the clown So my shit is an art and I am an artist Money is not the motive sure but being able to make money in the field is still important to encourage creators to join who otherwise might not Dont know jitna padh sakta tha padhu abb dekhte h  have lost all my will to study PCM  Dont know Hk sir but AKM  SBH aur NRT the mere batch mei  Okay bro one last time\n",
      "\n",
      "Look for an artist its not just about thinking of an ideaits about putting in the hard work to bring that vision to life Unlike me just giving a reference picture and saying Hey can you generate this in Studio Ghibli style and keep the faces as original as possible \n",
      "\n",
      "Now lets say youre an engineer  Are you just worth me sitting in a chair and typing a prompt Depends if you think its art then its art for you and not for others if they wont acknowledge it deleted Same man fuck jee honestly I just want this time to pass atp all the best Pata nhi fir mera dost jata tha HK sir ko bakta tha so I asked Gn No bro ive had enough Its boring now bye I should start selling my shit people who buy it shouldnt be considered fools then\n",
      "And Ai art is not art for artists the same way shit isnt art for a sane person\n",
      "So they are giving their concerns and opinions like a normal person would when people will start buying my shirt as some art\n",
      "\n",
      "If there isnt a criteria of anything how is it any different from something else Humans learn about things that way For you to know what a fan is you need to differentiate what a fan isnt \n",
      "Is earwax an art Or boogers Or soil Or potatoes  tomatoes \n",
      "Is trash an art \n",
      "But you can use trash to create art but trash in itself isnt an art So there are some conditions for something to fit a definitionthats what definitions are for \n",
      "\n",
      "Attraction of an object towards earth and its falling is called gravity  is attraction of two magnetic objects also gravity No\n",
      "\n",
      "Boundaries may be blurry but they do exist Thats the same shit they say to teachers therapists nurses etc to justify the low pay that they get It is wrong\n",
      "\n",
      "So NO People should get paid fairly for their work Just because you love your job and its a passion doesnt mean you deserve to be paid less for it Same to you dude and do share how it went Xd Sure\n"
